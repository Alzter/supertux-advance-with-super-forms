# SuperTux Advance

## Intro

SupterTux Advance is a fan game of SuperTux written in Squirrel using [Brux GDK](https://github.com/kelvinshadewing/brux-gdk). The name comes from the graphical style, which uses a lower resolution display and a sprite style similar to Sonic Advance. Gameplay is not a 1 to 1 recreation of SuperTux, nor does it aim to be. It's meant to be a more fast-paced action platformer than a Mario clone.

Some assets from SuperTux will be used, with graphics being remixed to match the game's visual style.

## Story

Capturing Gnu was only the beginning of Nolok's plan. While Tux and his friends ran the Grand Prix to challenge Nolok for Gnu's life, Nolok was busy setting traps for Tux's other friends. Now he holds them hostage while he works on his ultimate weapon, the Sliva Cannon! Tux must storm each of Nolok's forts and rescue his friends. He may even make some new friends along the way. Can Tux defeat Nolok in time to end the Third World War? And who the heck is Kooh?! One of these questions will be answered in SuperTux Advance!

## Installation

## Tips

* You gain more speed from sliding off a drop than down a hill. Falling speed is translated into horizontal momentum upon landing. Use this to maximize your speed.
* Practice wall jumping. Hold jump against the wall and press away from it. This isn't just helpful at navigating levels, it can save you if you fall into a pit.
* Fireballs have long range, but a slow rate of fire. Use them tactically; don't rely on them for up-close combat. That's best left to jumping and sliding.
* Muffins found in [?] boxes will restore health. Blueberry restores 4 health points, and strawberry restores all your health. Moldy green muffins will take health from you.
* On normal and easy mode, you'll recieve an extra life point after each boss. You don't get such boons on hard mode; you'll have to make do with the starting amount.
* Tux's fireballs don't rely on powerups for him to use them. Don't worry about being left defenseless if you get hurt.

# SuperTux Advance

## Intro

SupterTux Advance is a fan game of SuperTux written in Squirrel using [Brux GDK](https://github.com/kelvinshadewing/brux-gdk). The name comes from the graphical style, which uses a lower resolution display and a sprite style similar to Sonic Advance. Gameplay is not a 1 to 1 recreation of SuperTux, nor does it aim to be. It's meant to be a more fast-paced action platformer than a Mario clone.

Some assets from SuperTux will be used, with graphics being remixed to match the game's visual style.

## Installation

Follow the install instructions for Brux GDK, then run `tux.brx` with Brux.
